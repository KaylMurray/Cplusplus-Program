1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This is project two for the course, the banking app that we worked on. This program aims to solve the problem of creating a banking system and application that 
would allow the user to see the possible returns that they would have from their account depending on some variables. These variables being initial investment, 
monthly investment, annual interest, and for how many years this process would go on for. 
2. What did you do particularly well?
I think that with this code that I did fairly well tracking the correct amount of money that would be displayed to the user, along with this I think I handled 
the formatting of the outputs of the program well, with year end balance and year end balance with interest being formatted to be consistantly below the menu. 
3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think that something that would be interesting to see with this code would be changing the format of time, allowing for the program to output balance amounts 
if the user were to put a specific amount of months, such as 18 instead of a full year. Along with this I think that adding an option for annual deductions 
being taken into account would be an interesting concept to work out, to be able ot see what would be the real balance of the user after their neccesary 
expenses. 
4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support 
network?
I would say that the hardest part for this program would be outputting the statements to the user, as making sure that the rest of the menu lines up with the amounts as they change with varying inputs from the users. 
5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think that the most important skill that I have learned with this project is wokring with, and handling user inputs to varying degrees to allow them to get 
outputs to their desire. While I think that the possible changes that I presented above with having the concept of annual deduction, such as bill and spendings 
being accounted for, as well the user being able to specify the amounts of months they would want to invest would be a better user interface and intereaction 
with them. 
6. With this project, I had the code lined up to execute as the system reads it line by line, allowing for any programmer to see what they project will do step 
by step simply by reading top to bottom. However I think that I could have made some of the parts of the program into functions to make it easier to read and 
understand, as well as any possible changes that might want to be had would be easier to locate and alter.
